# Experiment to implement a simple editor with a plugin system

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies via `bun install`

## Get started

Start the dev server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Build the app for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
bun preview
```

## Maintenance

```

## Possible improvements

- When a non editable entry is selected => focus it.
- Move `rootKey` to the state.
